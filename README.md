# PHAS0077_ZHAOBO-WANG

This repository contains the code and report for my MSc final project on gravitational light deflection by solar system bodies and its impact on high-precision astrometry. The work combines planetary data, orbital dynamics, and relativistic formulas to compute maximum deflections, uncertainty ranges, impact parameters, and multi-body effects.

Contents

Mass&Radius.py / Data.py — Physical parameters and planetary datasets.

CES selection.py — Construction of CES positions relative to planetary vectors.

Projection & Distance.py — Impact parameter and projection geometry.

Synodic Period.py — Synodic period calculations relative to Earth.

Maximum Deflection Alphamax.py — Theoretical maximum deflections.

Mean & STD.py — Statistical uncertainty analysis.

Impact Ranges.py — Deflection thresholds and angular ranges.

Alpha-Beta Max&Min.py — Elongation angle dependence.

Perturbation Duration.py — Timescales of perturbation events.

Dual Deflection.py — Combined deflection from two bodies.




Requirements

Python 3.8+ with: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, skyfield

Each script can be run independently to reproduce different parts of the analysis.
